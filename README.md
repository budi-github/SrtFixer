# SrtFixer

## Introduction

[SubRip text files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip#SubRip_text_file_format) (extension .srt) are commonly used as a container of subtitles. These are text files formatted in a uniform way, which can be applied to most media formats such as .mp4 or .mkv.

Finding these files online often come riddled with formatting errors, from having incorrect spacing to too much text on one line. Also, many times these subtitles will not be in sync with the video.

SrtFixer fixes these problems and then some.
